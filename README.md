# software-engineering-project
This repository contains the official documents and artifacts for a two-part group project completed for a "Principles of Software Engineering" course. The project focuses on applying core software engineering concepts to a real-world problem: the design and analysis of a telemedicine system.
Key Deliverables & Skills Demonstrated:
Problem Analysis: Defining the problem statement and proposing a viable solution for a modern telemedicine platform.

Requirements Elicitation: Gathering and documenting both functional (e.g., appointment scheduling, online consultation) and non-functional (e.g., security, performance) requirements for the system.

Feasibility Study: Assessing the business viability and technical feasibility of the proposed telemedicine solution.

Architectural Design: Providing a high-level architectural overview of the system, including its main components and how they interact.

Business Analysis: Creating a vision and mission statement and evaluating the potential impact of the solution on patients and healthcare providers.
