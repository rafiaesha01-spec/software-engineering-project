# software-engineering-project
This repository contains the official documents and artifacts for a two-part group project completed for a "Principles of Software Engineering" course. The project focuses on applying core software engineering concepts to a real-world problem: the design and analysis of a telemedicine system.
Key Deliverables & Skills Demonstrated:
Problem Analysis: Defining the problem statement and proposing a viable solution for a modern telemedicine platform.

Requirements Elicitation: Gathering and documenting both functional (e.g., appointment scheduling, online consultation) and non-functional (e.g., security, performance) requirements for the system.

Feasibility Study: Assessing the business viability and technical feasibility of the proposed telemedicine solution.

Architectural Design: Providing a high-level architectural overview of the system, including its main components and how they interact.

Business Analysis: Creating a vision and mission statement and evaluating the potential impact of the solution on patients and healthcare providers.

Assignment 2: Telemedicine System Analysis, Design, and Testing
This assignment built upon the first, diving deep into the analysis and design of our telemedicine system. We created detailed diagrams and a comprehensive test plan to model the system's behavior and structure.

Key Deliverables & Skills Demonstrated:
UML Modeling: Creating a variety of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams to visualize the system's structure and behavior, including:

Use-Case Diagrams:  to describe user interactions such as logging in, scheduling appointments, and receiving prescriptions.

Class Diagrams:to show the structure of the system's data and objects.
* Sequence Diagrams:  to illustrate the flow of messages for key processes like online consultations.
* Activity Diagrams:  to model the flow of control within the system's core functions.
* State Chart Diagrams:  to represent the different states of objects like a patient's appointment.

User Interface (UI) Design: Proposing and designing a user-friendly interface for the telemedicine platform.

Testing & Quality Assurance: Developing a comprehensive Test Plan to ensure the system meets all requirements.

Design Rationale: Documenting the thought process behind design decisions, including strengths, weaknesses, and alternative ideas considered.

Teamwork Analysis: Reflecting on the group's strengths, weaknesses, and lessons learned from the project.

Lessons Learned & Conclusion
Through this two-part project, our team gained practical experience in applying a structured, disciplined approach to software development. We learned the critical importance of thorough requirements gathering and how different modeling tools, like UML diagrams, can effectively communicate complex system designs. This project reinforced the value of a strong foundation in design and planning before writing a single line of code, especially within a sensitive domain like telemedicine.
