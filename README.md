# software-engineering-project
This repository contains the official documents and artifacts for a two-part group project completed for a "Principles of Software Engineering" course. The project focuses on applying core software engineering concepts to a real-world problem: the design and analysis of a telemedicine system.
Key Deliverables & Skills Demonstrated:
Problem Analysis: Defining the problem statement and proposing a viable solution for a modern telemedicine platform.

Requirements Elicitation: Gathering and documenting both functional (e.g., appointment scheduling, online consultation) and non-functional (e.g., security, performance) requirements for the system.

Feasibility Study: Assessing the business viability and technical feasibility of the proposed telemedicine solution.

Architectural Design: Providing a high-level architectural overview of the system, including its main components and how they interact.

Business Analysis: Creating a vision and mission statement and evaluating the potential impact of the solution on patients and healthcare providers.
Assignment 1: Telemedicine System Requirements and Architectural Design
PSE Group Assignment (Discussion).pdf
Assignment 2: Telemedicine System Analysis, Design, and Testing
This assignment built upon the first, diving deep into the analysis and design of our telemedicine system. We created detailed diagrams and a comprehensive test plan to model the system's behavior and structure.

Key Deliverables & Skills Demonstrated:
UML Modeling: Creating a variety of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams to visualize the system's structure and behavior, including:

Use-Case Diagrams:  to describe user interactions such as logging in, scheduling appointments, and receiving prescriptions.

Class Diagrams:to show the structure of the system's data and objects.
* Sequence Diagrams:  to illustrate the flow of messages for key processes like online consultations.
* Activity Diagrams:  to model the flow of control within the system's core functions.
* State Chart Diagrams:  to represent the different states of objects like a patient's appointment.

User Interface (UI) Design: Proposing and designing a user-friendly interface for the telemedicine platform.

Testing & Quality Assurance: Developing a comprehensive Test Plan to ensure the system meets all requirements.

Design Rationale: Documenting the thought process behind design decisions, including strengths, weaknesses, and alternative ideas considered.

Teamwork Analysis: Reflecting on the group's strengths, weaknesses, and lessons learned from the project.
